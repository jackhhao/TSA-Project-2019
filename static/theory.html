                For the volatility calculations finds the absolute value of the percent change for the last 10 days
                and averages the ten values. When calculating overall trend we find the volatility for the last
                 10 days and them all together<></center></td>
              <td id = "p1"><center>The buying and selling prices were determined by finding the range of prices where
                 the stock was the most recent in the last 10 days. First, a list of the lowest price on each day
                  and the highest price on each day was created, and these lists were sorted efficiently from least
                   to greatest. Then, an array was created with the values from both lists. The code then traversed
                    through this array, and a counter tracked the number of days in which each price occured. While
                    keeping track of the maximum value of the counter and the minimum and maximum values such that the
                    counter was at its maximum value, the required range was determined. The lower value is the buying
                    price, and the higher value is the selling price.</center></td>
              <td id = "r1"><center>The rating is determined by factoring in volume, sentiment analysis of conversations and articles.
                We also use volatility, the overall trend, and the standard deviation from volatility. We rated volume using a logistic curve so lower extreme values would not affect rating while the upper ratings would cap out at a certain point. The equation we used for our S curve was <br>100/(1 + 10.77e^{-1.2x}}</center></td>

                  an online source, in this case Yahoo Finance. The graphs are used to forecast the stock price based off of historical patterns.</center></td>
